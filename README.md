The BACKEND is built using Node.js and Express.js.
Routing, controllers, and user validation are implemented to structure the application and handle client requests effectively.

The backend is connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, which provides a clean and schema-based solution for data modeling.

CRUD operations are implemented for both users and places, and a relational connection between users and their associated places is established.
